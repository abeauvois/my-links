The author argues that despite widespread reluctance to share sensitive information with large tech companies like Google and OpenAI, many organizations are unknowingly doing exactly that by using closed-source APIs. The tweet highlights a growing concern about the lack of transparency and control when businesses integrate proprietary AI services, suggesting that open-source models might offer a more secure and trustworthy alternative. The message emphasizes the potential risks of sending proprietary code, customer data, and business logic through third-party, closed-source platforms without fully understanding the implications of data sharing and potential misuse."

The method involves multiple neural network 'blobs' with random initial weights that gradually improve their accuracy at adding two-digit numbers through an evolutionary process. The creator claims approximately 80% accuracy can be achieved in just 5 minutes, and the project is open source. This represents an alternative machine learning technique that differs from standard neural network training methods, potentially offering a novel computational approach to problem-solving."
